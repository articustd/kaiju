<h1>Help</h1>
!!Combat
-----
Reduce the enemies health down to 0 to win. Use items to heal or run away if the fight is too difficult!

''Winning'' - Will randomly give you items and credits. After winning you can choose to consume the enemy, doing so will grant a random amount of Experience suited for the enemy type.
''Losing'' - When you lose a fight you will be knocked out, transported home, and 1/4 of your credit will be removed. If you are currently carrying prey, one of them will be randomly taken.

!!Leveling Up
-----
To level up you must have consumed any amount of enemies. You will need to head home and rest to absorb the prey and gain their experience. Experience will be added up and if your experience totals to atleast your level for that stat. Example: Strength = 15, Muscle Experience needs to be 15 or higher.

!!Capacity
-----
As you consume enemies your immediate capacity will fill up. Once you reach your max capacity, enemies will randomly spawn in the station and towns until you make it back home to rest. Once rested, a fourth of the capacity you had consumed will be added to your overall max capacity. If you favor one specific consume over another, you will have a larger capacity for the favored consume type.

Your starting capacity will be your starting size minus one.

Prey capacity amounts are as follows:
|''Size''|''Amount''|
|Micro|1|
|Tiny|2|
|Mini|3|
|Small|4|
|Average|5|
|Tall|6|
|Huge|7|
|Massize|8|
|Macro|9|
