<h1>Attribute Wing</h1><<set _cost to 500>>
Walking into the Attribute Wing you see a few technicians walking around, but no one seems to notice you. Tarps are covering most of the machinary and lab equipemnt to keep costruction dust off them.

In the corner of the room you see what can only be descriped as a blood pressure testing device like you've seen in malls. Walking over to it you notice instead of a screen there is a tablet connected to it. On the tablet you see three sections, each with a different attribute name and some buttons.

"Attribute changes are permanent and will charge 500 credits for increases. Removing attributes will refund 500 credits."
